This study analyzed data from 227 ischemic stroke patients at XX Hospital, focusing on 40 clinical indicators. The objective was to estimate infarct volume by addressing missing data and refine the model through variable selection, identifying critical indicators affecting infarct volume predictions. Methods like complete data, regression imputation, and Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) were used for data imputation, with the IPW method resulting in the most accurate model. Variable selection was done using SCAD and LASSO penalties, and the study compared the mean squared errors of different models in estimating infarct volume. The model obtained using SCAD penalization on IPW-imputed data was found to be most effective, highlighting the significant influence of nine specific clinical indicators on infarct volume estimation.
